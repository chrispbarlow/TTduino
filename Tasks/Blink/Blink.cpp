/*
 * Blink.cpp
 *
 * A simple TT task example, replicating the classic Arduino 'Blink' project:
 * Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
 *
 * Works the same as:
 *
 * void loop() {
 *	 digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // set the LED on
 * 	 delay(1000);              // wait for a second
 *	 digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // set the LED off
 * 	 delay(1000);              // wait for a second
 * }
 *
 * but allows other processing to happen during the delays.
